1) cat
2) dog
3) squirrel
4) spider
5) butterfly
6) horse
7) cow
8) sheep
9) elephant
10) chicken

I- Content
  - Setup:
    - Imports all necessary libraries.
  - Functions:
    - Defines functions for visualization, classification report generation, and confusion matrix plotting.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Lists the classes in the dataset.
    - Displays a sample image from each class.
    - Analyzes the class distribution.
    - Checks image dimensions.
  - Data Preparation:
    - Defines data generators for training and validation sets with data augmentation techniques like rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping.
    - Preprocesses and loads the training and validation data.
  - Model Architecture:
    - Defines a CNN model with convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, batch normalization layers, a flattening layer, and fully-connected layers with ReLU and softmax activations.
    - Prints a summary of the model architecture.
  - Model Training:
    - Compiles the model with the Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy metric.
    - Defines callbacks for early stopping, model checkpointing, and learning rate reduction.
    - Trains the model on the training data with validation on the validation data.
  - Model Evaluation:
    - Plots the training and validation loss and accuracy curves.
    - Plots the confusion matrix for the validation set.
    - Generates a classification report for the validation set.
    - Evaluates the model on the test set (Note: This should be used instead of the validation set for final evaluation).
    - Displays predicted labels and accuracies for a sample of test set images.
  - Loaded Model Procedure (Optional):
    - Defines functions for visualization, classification report generation, and confusion matrix plotting (same as before).
    - Loads a pre-trained model saved during training.
    - Evaluates the loaded model on the validation and test sets using the functions defined earlier.
  - Future Improvements
    - Transfer Learning: Explore using pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet50 as a base and fine-tuning them for this specific dataset.
    - Dropout Layers: Introduce dropout layers between convolutional layers to prevent overfitting.
    - Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, number of filters, etc.) to potentially improve model performance.
    - Fine-Tuning: Further optimize the model by adjusting the number of layers, kernel sizes, and other hyperparameters.
    - Batch Normalization Layers: Explore adding Batch Normalization layers after convolutional layers to improve model stability and training speed.

II- AI Concepts Used

A) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):

1) Convolutional Layers: Extract features from images by applying filters.
2) Max Pooling Layers: Downsample the feature maps to reduce computational cost and prevent overfitting.
3) Activation Functions (ReLU): Introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns.

B) Data Augmentation:

- Transformations: Apply random transformations to the training data (rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, flipping) to increase its diversity and prevent overfitting.

C) Batch Normalization:
- Normalization: Standardizes the inputs to each layer, improving training stability and reducing the need for careful initialization.

D) Early Stopping:
- Preventing Overfitting: Stops training when the validation loss stops improving, preventing the model from learning noise in the training data.

E) Model Checkpoint:
- Saving Best Model: Saves the model with the best validation performance, ensuring the most accurate model is retained.

F) Learning Rate Reduction:
- Fine-Tuning: Gradually reduces the learning rate during training to allow the model to converge to a more accurate solution.

G) Classification Report:
- Evaluation Metric: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class, giving a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.

H) Confusion Matrix:
- Visualization: Visualizes the model's performance by showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.
